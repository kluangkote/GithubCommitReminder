# Github Commit Reminder
Receive a daily text reminder to continue your Github commit streak. Text back to change the time of your reminder or to turn reminders on and off.

See source code comments for further instructions. Note: You must host the flask app on your own server for Twilio to receive your texts. Also, do not forget to change your Request URL to "yoururlhere.com/receiveSMS" under "Messaging" for your Twilio number.
